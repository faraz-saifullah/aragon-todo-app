   - Create a board (automatically creates default columns)
   - Create/edit/delete custom columns with colors
   - Create tasks and assign to users
   - Edit a task (show assignee dropdown and history tracking)
   - Move tasks between columns
   - Delete a task (show confirmation modal)
   - Delete a board (show toast notification)
   - Show responsive design on mobile

2. **Code Walkthrough** (3-4 min)
   - Architecture overview (service layer pattern)
   - Show API routes (15 endpoints across 4 resources)
   - Explain service layer (board, task, column, user services)
   - Show database schema (5 models with relationships)
   - Highlight validation (Zod schemas)
   - Show task history middleware
   - Show toast notification context
   - Discuss design decisions

3. **Technical Discussion** (2-3 min)
