# [Aragon.ai](http://Aragon.ai) Full Stack Project

Hello! Thanks for participating in Aragon.ai’s technical interview today!

Your challenge will be to build a basic task management app. There is a time limit with this challenge, so it’s essential to prioritize the most important features. For example it’s better to implement 7/10 requirements well, than it is to do 10/10 requirements poorly. It’s highly recommended that during the challenge you use AI tools such as chatgpt, claude, deepseek to help accelerate your progress.

However keep in mind that AI is not a replacement for code quality or craftsmanship. For example, relying on the agent feature to build your entire app will lead to issues like poor code quality, visual design issues, bugs, bad ux, architecture, and hallucinations. If AI could handle this perfectly, there would be no need for human engineers. It’s still essential to demonstrate your technical skill and craftsmanship — use AI as a tool to boost your efficiency, not as a substitute for expertise.

## Requirements

Your users should be able to:

Frontend

- Create, read, update, and delete boards and tasks
- There should be frontend form validations when trying to create/edit boards and tasks
- Use state management on frontend (i.e. react hooks)
- Hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Use the optimal responsive layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- You should not use any external component library. Everything should be using react components.
- Visually it should be high fidelity and look similar to the sample screenshot shared above

Backend

- Develop a API using Node.js and Express or graphql (or Next.js API routes)
- Use PostgreSQL as the database and follow good system design principles
- Ensure API endpoints follow proper conventions (e.g., CRUD operations for boards and tasks)
- Implement validation and error handling for API requests
- Use an ORM (i.e knex.js, prisma, objection, etc.) for database interactions
- Optimize database queries for performance and scalability
- Implement logging and monitoring for debugging and analytics

## Not Required

Following features are not required. But if you have time can implement as a bonus

- Allow users to drag and drop tasks to change their status and re-order them in a column
- Being able to add status columns
- Light/Dark Mode
- User authentication
- Don’t worry about tasks vs subtasks.

### Submission Instructions

Take up to 2.5 hr to work on the challenge

Take up to 30 minutes for the submission

Total max time is 3 hours

Send the final solution to akhil@aragon.ai

When you send the solution. Include the source code either via google drive or github link.

Include a [loom](https://www.loom.com/) or screen recording with your submission where you explain the functionality that you’ve built. You should also walk through the feature visually and show the UI in addition to discussing the code and technical decisions/tradeoffs. Communication here will be important.
