# ðŸŽ¥ LOOM VIDEO SCRIPT (10 minutes)

## Aragon.ai Full-Stack Assessment Walkthrough

---

## **PART 1: INTRODUCTION & DEMO (3 minutes)**

### Opening (15 seconds)

_"Hi! I'm [Your Name], and I'm excited to walk you through my Kanban task management app built for the Aragon.ai assessment. I've built a production-ready, full-stack application with some impressive features beyond the requirements. Let me show you what I built."_

---

### Live Demo (2 min 45 sec)

#### **Feature 1: Board Management** (30 sec)

_Screen: Show sidebar with multiple boards_

- _"First, you'll see the sidebar with all boards. I have 3 pre-seeded boards here."_
- **ACTION**: Click between boards
- _"Notice how the selection persists even after refreshâ€”I'm using localStorage for this."_
- **ACTION**: Click "+ Create New Board"
- _"Creating a board is straightforwardâ€”title with character counter, optional description, real-time validation."_
- **ACTION**: Type in form, show character counter
- _"See the onBlur validation and the loading spinner when submitting."_

#### **Feature 2: Custom Columns (BONUS)** (45 sec)

_Screen: Show board with custom columns_

- _"Here's a key feature I added beyond requirements: **custom status columns**."_
- **ACTION**: Click "Add Column" button
- _"You're not limited to TODO/DOING/DONE. You can create 'In Review', 'Blocked', 'Testing'â€”whatever workflow you need."_
- **ACTION**: Show color picker
- _"Each column has a custom color for visual organization. I've built a color picker with 6 preset colors."_
- **ACTION**: Create a new column (e.g., "In Review" with orange color)
- _"And it updates instantly with proper ordering."_

#### **Feature 3: Task Management** (45 sec)

_Screen: Show task operations_

- **ACTION**: Click "Add Task" in a column
- _"Tasks have full CRUD operations. Notice the form has auto-focus, character counters, and onBlur validation."_
- **ACTION**: Create a task
- _"Tasks show in cards with subtle hover effects and status color indicators on the left border."_
- **ACTION**: Hover over task, click to edit
- _"You can edit any taskâ€”change title, description, move between columns via the status dropdown."_
- **ACTION**: Hover and click delete
- _"Deleting shows a confirmationâ€”currently using window.confirm, which I'd replace with a custom modal in production."_

#### **Feature 4: Responsive Design** (30 sec)

_Screen: Resize browser or use DevTools device toggle_

- **ACTION**: Toggle to mobile view
- _"The app is fully responsive with mobile-first design."_
- **ACTION**: Click hamburger menu
- _"Mobile users get a hamburger menu with a proper close button."_
- **ACTION**: Show board selection on mobile
- _"Navigation adapts perfectly, and there's a body scroll lock when modals are open."_

## **PART 2: TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE (4 minutes)**

### Database & Backend (1 min 30 sec)

_Screen: Open Prisma schema file_

```prisma
model Board {
  id          String         @id @default(uuid())
  title       String
  columns     StatusColumn[]  // Custom columns!
  tasks       Task[]
}

model StatusColumn {
  id      String  @id
  boardId String
  name    String
  order   Int
  color   String?
  tasks   Task[]
  @@unique([boardId, name])  // No duplicates!
}

model Task {
  id          String @id
  statusId    String  // Links to StatusColumn
  boardId     String
}
```

_"My database architecture has 3 tables with cascade deletes:"_

- _"**Board â†’ StatusColumn** (1:Many) - Each board has custom columns"_
- _"**StatusColumn â†’ Task** (1:Many) - Each column has tasks"_
- _"**Board â†’ Task** (1:Many) - For direct board access"_

_"Key design decisions:"_

- _"Used **StatusColumn model** instead of enum for flexibilityâ€”users can create any workflow"_
- _"**Cascade deletes** ensure data integrity"_
- _"**Database indexes** on boardId, statusId, and order for performance"_
- _"**Unique constraint** prevents duplicate column names per board"_

### Service Layer Pattern (45 sec)

_Screen: Show lib/services/ folder_

_"I implemented a **service layer pattern** for clean architecture:"_

- _"`board.service.ts` - Board CRUD with order management"_
- _"`column.service.ts` - Column operations"_
- _"`task.service.ts` - Task operations"_

_"This separates business logic from API routes, making it easier to test and reuse. Each service handles database operations, validation, and relationship management."_

### API Layer (45 sec)

_Screen: Show app/api/ folder structure_

_"My API follows RESTful conventions:"_

- _"**10 endpoints** across boards, columns, and tasks"_
- _"Consistent error handling with `handleApiError` utility"_
- _"Zod schemas for input validation on every endpoint"_
- _"Returns typed responses with proper status codes"_

_"Example: Creating a column validates the name, checks for duplicates, auto-assigns order, and returns the created column."_

### Frontend Architecture (1 min)

_Screen: Show components/ folder_

_"Frontend has **9 custom components**â€”no external UI libraries:"_

- _"**Navigation/BoardList** - Sidebar with responsive design"_
- _"**BoardView/KanbanColumn** - JIRA-style unified scrolling"_
- _"**TaskCard** - With status color borders and hover states"_
- _"**Modal system** - Reusable with body scroll lock"_
- _"**3 form modals** - Board, Task, Column"_

_"State management uses React hooks:"_

- _"`useBoards` - Manages board list and CRUD"_
- _"`useBoard` - Fetches single board with columns/tasks"_
- _"Custom hooks keep components clean"_

---

## **PART 3: CODE QUALITY & TESTING (1.5 minutes)**

### Testing (30 sec)

_Screen: Run `npm run test`_

_"I implemented **9 passing tests** covering:"_

- _"API route tests - Board creation with valid/invalid data"_
- _"Service layer tests - Business logic and error handling"_
- _"Using Jest with proper mocking of Prisma"_

_"Test coverage focuses on critical pathsâ€”boards API and service layer. In production, I'd add component tests with React Testing Library."_

### Type Safety (30 sec)

_Screen: Show lib/types.ts and hover over some code_

_"**100% TypeScript coverage** with strict mode:"_

- _"No `any` types anywhere"_
- _"Zod schemas validate at runtime"_
- _"Prisma generates types from schema"_
- _"Full type safety from database to UI"_

### Code Quality (30 sec)

_Screen: Show package.json scripts_

_"Professional development setup:"_

- _"**ESLint** for code linting"_
- _"**Prettier** for consistent formatting"_
- _"**Docker Compose** for PostgreSQL"_
- _"**.env.example** for easy setup"_
- _"Comprehensive **README** with quick start guide"_

## **PART 4: TECHNICAL DECISIONS & TRADEOFFS (1.5 minutes)**

### What Went Well âœ… (45 sec)

_Screen: Back to app_

1. **"Custom Columns Feature"** - _"I went beyond requirements and built flexible workflows. This is a major differentiator from basic TODO/DOING/DONE apps."_

2. **"Performance Optimization"** - _"Database indexes, optimized queries, efficient state management. This scales to thousands of tasks."_

3. **"Responsive Design"** - _"Pixel-perfect mobile experience with hamburger menu, body scroll lock, proper breakpoints."_

4. **"Professional UX"** - _"Auto-focus, character counters, onBlur validation, loading spinners, empty states, status color codingâ€”everything feels polished."_

5. **"Clean Architecture"** - _"Service layer pattern, separation of concerns, reusable components. Easy to maintain and extend."_

### Tradeoffs Made ðŸ¤” (45 sec)

1. **"window.confirm for Delete"**
   - _"Used browser native confirm dialog"_
   - _"TRADEOFF: Quick to implement, but not styled or accessible"_
   - _"PRODUCTION FIX: Would build custom confirmation modal (~20 min)"_

2. **"No Drag & Drop"**
   - _"Didn't implement drag-and-drop for tasks/columns"_
   - _"TRADEOFF: Would use dnd-kit library, but adds complexity"_
   - _"ASSESSMENT: Not required, focused on core CRUD and polish"_

3. **"Client-Side State vs React Query"**
   - _"Used custom hooks instead of React Query/SWR"_
   - _"TRADEOFF: Simpler for this scope, but no caching/deduplication"_
   - _"PRODUCTION FIX: Would migrate to React Query for better performance (~1-2 hours)"_

4. **"Limited Test Coverage"**
   - _"9 tests covering API/service layer, no component tests"_
   - _"TRADEOFF: Focused on backend logic first"_
   - _"PRODUCTION FIX: Would add RTL tests for all components (~2-3 hours)"_

5. **"No Optimistic UI Updates"**
   - _"UI waits for API responses"_
   - _"TRADEOFF: Simpler implementation, but slight delay"_
   - _"PRODUCTION FIX: Would implement optimistic updates with rollback (~1 hour)"_

---

## **CLOSING (30 seconds)**

_"To summarize what I built in ~5.5 hours:"_

- âœ… _"All required features: CRUD for boards/tasks, validation, responsive design, hover states"_
- âœ… _"**BONUS**: Custom columns feature with color coding"_
- âœ… _"Service layer architecture, RESTful API, PostgreSQL with optimized indexes"_
- âœ… _"9 passing tests, 100% TypeScript, production-ready code quality"_
- âœ… _"9 custom components, comprehensive documentation"_

_"The app is **production-ready** with room for enhancements. I demonstrated not just coding ability, but architectural thinking, attention to UX, and professional development practices."_

_"I'm excited to discuss any technical decisions further. Thanks for watching!"_
